# Merge Meetings

    Write a function mergeRanges() that takes an array of multiple meeting time ranges and returns an array of condensed ranges.

# Reverse String in Place

    Write a function that takes an array of characters and reverses the letters in place.

# Reverse Words in Place

    You're working on a secret team solving coded transmissions.
    Your team is scrambling to decipher a recent message, worried it's a plot to break into a major European National Cake Vault. The message has been mostly deciphered, but all the words are backward! Your colleagues have handed off the last step to you.
    Write a function reverseWords() that takes a message as an array of characters and reverses the order of the words in place.

# Merge Arrays

    Each order is represented by an "order id" (an integer).
    We have our lists of orders sorted numerically already, in arrays. Write a function to merge our arrays of orders into one sorted array.

# isFirstComeFirstServed

    I have two registers: one for take-out orders, and the other for the other folks eating inside the cafe. All the customer orders get combined into one list for the kitchen, where they should be handled first-come, first-served.

    Recently, some customers have been complaining that people who placed orders after them are getting their food first. Yikesâ€”that's not good for business!

    To investigate their claims, one afternoon I sat behind the registers with my laptop and recorded:

    The take-out orders as they were entered into the system and given to the kitchen. (takeOutOrders)
    The dine-in orders as they were entered into the system and given to the kitchen. (dineInOrders)
    Each customer order (from either register) as it was finished by the kitchen. (servedOrders)
    Given all three arrays, write a function to check that my service is first-come, first-served. All food should come out in the same order customers requested it.
